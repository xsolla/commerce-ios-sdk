  s.description  = <<-DESC
                   The library allows opening payment UI via web to use main Pay Station features:
                     * purchases for 130+ currencies
                     * purchases via 700+ payment methods
                     * built-in anti-fraud
                     * payment UI localized in 20 languages
                     * purchase refund
                   The Payments SDK is required to work with payments when using the Store SDK, but it also can be used separately.

                   NOTE: The SDK is written in pure Swift. You can use it in Swift or mixed-language projects. Pure Objective-C projects are not supported.
